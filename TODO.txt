add some progress reporting


implement collections of various formulas leading to the same result


prefer multiplications and additions over other operations - these machines are easier to place in the game


OPTIMISATIONS

implement proper max-operations restriction - I have not yet seen a case that requires more than 5

make the application stateful-interactive - a user first enters target number and then keeps adding available numbers they see on the screen

any way to reduce the range of 4B numbers into buckets?
- don't pick all available numbers at once - pick first and last, try all operations, then add a next number - multiple results, first won't be the best

alternative non-bruteforce algorithm
- start from target number and try to reach initial numbers
- find prime factors, add them to the list of targets
- for each number in the list of targets add/subtract all the initial numbers - add the results to targets
